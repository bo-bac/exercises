# Clean Code
This ejercicio was requested by one colleague

He just finished to read Clean Code of Robert C. Martin and came to 
>Чистий код Роберта Мартіна не такий вже чистий? 

(Is Robert Martin's clean code not so clean? - translation is mine)

From the book
>I wrote the module in Listing 4-7 for the first XP Immersion. It was intended to be an example of bad coding and commenting style. Kent Beck then refactored this code into a much more pleasant form in front of several dozen enthusiastic students. Later I adapted the example for my book Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices and the first of my Craftsman articles published in Software Development magazine. What I find fascinating about this module is that there was a time when many of us would have considered it «well documented.» Now we see it as a small mess. See how many different comment problems you can find.

It must be Mr. Martin pointing out that function is big and complicated but overcommented.

And then Uncle Bob continue. 

>In Listing 4-8 you can see a refactored version of the same module. Note that the use of comments is significantly restrained. There are just two comments in the whole module. Both comments are explanatory in nature.

So happened my colleague has supposed provided refactoring has made code worse and tried to re-refactor it and asked us to do so
